# My OpenTK Engine

Hobbyist mucking about with [the Open Toolkit](https://opentk.net/).

* **Core:** A few low-level classes that wrap around the static API classes presented by the Open Toolkit
* **ReactiveBuffers:** Building on top of core, some logic for managing buffer content via [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/).
* **Views:** Building on top of Core and ReactiveBuffers, a simple-to-the-point-of-naivety rendering engine.

## Usage
